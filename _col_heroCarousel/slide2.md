title: Applying V-pipe to SARS-Coronavirus-2 data
description: This short webinar explains — and demonstrates — the use of V-pipe, an end-to-end bioinformatics pipeline that integrates various computational tools for the analysis of SARS-Coronavirus-2 high-throughput sequencing data. It supports the reproducible analysis of genomic diversity in intra-host virus populations for both basic research and medical diagnostics.
