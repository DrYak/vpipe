title: Vpipe featuring LolliPop
description: |
  LolliPop is a tool for Wastewater Genomics for deconvolution of viral variants and estimation of their relative abundance, even in case of shared mutations among variants. It is resilient to noise and overdispersion in the sequencing data, and leverages the time series.
